            The Pareto diagram.
        </h3>
        <p>
            This concept is related to the 80/20 principle where you typically find that one or two items make up for 80% of your “Murphy”
            and downtime items. Start by identifying your top 5 Pareto items and focus your improvement on #1 and #2 only. If starvation
            from upstream machines/departments is a concern just do your best – your next Green belt will offer a full solution.

            This Lean Manufacturing tool makes it simple to visually see the items that take up the most time in a certain process. This
            Tool comes in handy for analyzing set-up times or shift change-over times.

            The Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) process.
        </h3>
        <p>
            This concept is used for set-up or tool change over time reduction. It first identifies any opportunities for doing some of the
            set-up work while the machine is still running (external) and then moves the focus on improving the remaining internal tasks.
        </p>

            Plus many others.
        </h3>
        <p>


            These include among others, Ishikawa (fish bone) diagrams, Current Reality trees, Conflict Clouds, Spaghetti diagrams, Kaizen events and many more.
            Important: do NOT let the tools delay your efforts to improve the Constraint Utilization. Often identifying your #1 and #2 Pareto items is enough
            to make a good improvement.
